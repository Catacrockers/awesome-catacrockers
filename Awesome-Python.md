## Code Analysis

*Tools of static analysis, linters and code quality checkers.*

- [Pylint](https://www.pylint.org/) - A fully customizable source code analyzer. Pylint is a Python static code analysis tool which looks for programming errors, helps enforcing a coding standard, sniffs for code smells and offers simple refactoring suggestions.

## Configuration

- [Aumbry](https://aumbry.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) - general purpose library for handling configuration within your Python applications. The project was born from constantly needing a simple interface for configuration models that came from multiple data sources.

## Command-line Tools

*Libraries for building command-line application.*

+ Productivity Tools
  - [parallel_foreach_submodule (PFS)](https://github.com/RDCH106/parallel_foreach_submodule) - Tool for "git submodule foreach" execution in parallel.
  - [pipdeptree](https://github.com/naiquevin/pipdeptree) - A command line utility to display dependency tree of the installed Python packages.

## GUI

*Libraries for working with graphical user interface applications.*

+ [Gooey](https://github.com/chriskiehl/Gooey) - Turn command line programs into a full GUI application with one line.
+ [remi](https://github.com/dddomodossola/remi) - Python REMote Interface library. Platform independent. In about 100 Kbytes, perfect for your diet. 

## HTTP

Libraries for working with HTTP.

+ [requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/) - HTTP Requests for Humans‚Ñ¢.

## Logging

- [Structlog](https://github.com/hynek/structlog) - makes logging in Python less painful and more powerful by adding structure to your log entries.

## RESTful API

*Libraries for developing RESTful APIs.*

+ Flask
  - [flask-restful](https://github.com/flask-restful/flask-restful) - Quickly building REST APIs for Flask.
  - [linkero](https://github.com/ingran/linkero) - Restful API for external requests with access control

+ Framework agnostic
  - [falcon](http://falconframework.org/) - A high-performance framework for building cloud APIs and web app backends.
  - [hug](https://github.com/timothycrosley/hug) - A Python3 framework for cleanly exposing APIs over HTTP and the Command Line with automatic documentation and validation.
  
## Reactive programming

*Functional Programming with Python.*

- [rxpy](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxPY) - 
A library for composing asynchronous and event-based programs using observable collections and LINQ-style query operators in Python.

## Testing

*Libraries for testing codebases and generating test data.*

+ Testing Frameworks
  - [Pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/) - A mature full-featured Python testing tool. The pytest framework makes it easy to write small tests, yet scales to support complex functional testing for applications and libraries.

## Web Frameworks

*Full stack web frameworks.*

- [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) - A microframework for Python.
